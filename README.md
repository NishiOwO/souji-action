Souji Action is a GitHub Action that deletes all GitHub Actions Caches related
to the context of the triggered workflow event, without any configuration
required.

## Why

GitHub Actions Caches have
[branch scope restriction](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache)
in place. This means that there are caches that will never be restored in the
future. This action allows you to easily delete such caches.

## Usage

`actions:write` permission is
[required to delete caches](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/cache?apiVersion=2022-11-28#delete-a-github-actions-cache-for-a-repository-using-a-cache-id).

      - closed

```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

This workflow cleans up caches for branches when they are merged(closed) or
deleted. \
This will clear the following cache:

- merge ref `refs/pull/<number>/merge`
  - When a pull request is merged or closed, this workflow removes cached data
    associated with the merge ref.
- branch `<branch name>`
  - When a branch is deleted, this workflow deletes the cached data associated
    with the branch.

## Inputs

> [!NOTE]\
> `List` type is a string of characters separated by newlines or spaces.

>   refs/tags/1.0.0
> ```

> ```yml
> branch-names: main refs/pull/123/merge refs/tags/1.0.0

| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `dry-run`      | If `true`, dry-run caches deletion.                                                                    | Boolean | `false` |
| `branch-names` | List of branch(ref) names with caches to be deleted (e.g., `main refs/pull/123/merge refs/tags/1.0.0`) | List    | N/A     |

## Supported events

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> The branch(ref) to be deleted is determined by the context of the event.\
> Please note that this is not the same as `$GITHUB_REF`(`github.ref`).

[^1]: Only works with pull request comments.
[^2]:
    This action doesn't work when triggered by a `pull_request` event if the
    pull request is a cross-repository pull request.\
    Therefore, it is recommended to use the `pull_request_target` event instead.
